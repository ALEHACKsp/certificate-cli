## Vulnerability Patch - Spoofing Other Certificates

With both features of selective privacy and batched issurance, recipient could spoof one another's certificate data. Below is an example. 

***Certificate 1***

```
{
	evidence.0.name: 'Algorithms',
	evidence.0.description: 'E'
}

Issued to Recipient A
MerkleRoot: 0x00A
```

***Certificate 2***

```
{
	evidence.0.name: 'Data Structure',
	evidence.0.description: 'A'
}

Issued to Recipient B
MerkleRoot: 0x00B
```

Recipient A could claim to have 'A' for his Algorithms class and provide a valid claim to the merkle root.

##Solutions##

1. Issue each certificate individually. However, the gas cost is found to be linear, it will be very expensive to scale. 
2. Verify entire certificate with masked data, instead of using individual claims. However, there may be information leak as we can enumerate through known grades/subjects/etc. 
3. Add a salt that is unique to every certificate, allowing us to see if the data has been spoofed. Example below:

```
{
	evidence.0.name: '[66f5ad0]Algorithms',
	evidence.0.description: '[66f5ad0]E'
	salt:'[66f5ad0]'
}

Issued to Recipient A
MerkleRoot: 0x00A
```
or

```
{
	[66f5ad0].evidence.0.name: 'Algorithms',
	[66f5ad0].evidence.0.description: 'E'
}

Issued to Recipient A
MerkleRoot: 0x00A
```
